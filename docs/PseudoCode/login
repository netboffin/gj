Login System

Today I'm starting work on the login system.

The functionality purpose of the code is to allow authentic users to log in to their accounts with the correct authorization.

*** Input ***
The input to the system is a username and password

username has to be more than 3 letters, password has to be more than six.

*** Output ***
The output of the system is : 
Message your logged in, and a list of projects the user has access right to.

*** Data Handling ***
Connects to the goject database looks in the account table for the username in the AccountUsername field. 
If it exists it checks to see if the password hash associated with the username is the same as the password hash for the password entered in the log in form.

The password has to be compared with a hash.
We need some test data to check if the login system works.
